                "D": "Look at the rearview mirror"
            },
            "answer": "C",
            "explanation": "Option A, 'Check both side mirrors,' provides limited visibility and is insufficient for a comprehensive view of the rear. Option B, 'Check all rearview mirrors,' is better than A but still leaves blind spots. Option C, 'Turn around and look through the rear window,' offers the clearest rear view and is the correct method. Option D, 'Look at the rearview mirror,' is too limited and can overlook obstacles.",

                "D": "Large vehicles may roll back when starting, hitting your car"
            },
            "answer": "D",
            "explanation": "Option A, 'You can be seen by the vehicle in front,' is not directly related to safety. Option B, 'You won’t inhale the truck's exhaust,' is beneficial to health but unrelated to safety. Option C, 'You can bypass it when it starts slowly,' is dangerous, especially if the vehicle rolls back. Option D, 'Large vehicles may roll back when starting, hitting your car,' explains the correct reason.",

            },
            "answer": "A",
            "explanation": "Option A, 'Increase the space in front of your car,' reduces the likelihood of needing to brake suddenly, minimizing the risk of an accident. Option B, 'Increase the space behind your car,' is nearly impossible when a car is tailgating. Option C, 'Honk and flash your brake lights,' may alarm or provoke the tailgating driver. Option D, 'Brake sharply and drive away quickly,' significantly increases the risk of a rear-end collision.",

                "D": "To inform the cyclist that there is a vehicle nearby"
            },
            "answer": "B",
            "explanation": "This question is somewhat tricky to understand. The analysis should go as follows: Drivers generally should not honk at cyclists unless in special situations that require issuing a warning. By elimination, options A, C, and D describe common situations. If honking were necessary in these cases, roads would constantly be filled with honking sounds.",

            },
            "answer": "C",
            "explanation": "Option A, 'Stop, proceed when safe,' confuses the rules for a yellow light. Option B, 'Stop, except for a right turn,' applies in specific situations. Option C, 'Stop before the intersection,' clearly explains the red light rule. Option D, 'Stop if there is an approaching vehicle,' is incorrect.",

                "D": "Vehicle A"
            },
            "answer": "A",
            "explanation": "This is a tricky question. First, the options and vehicles do not match one-to-one. Second, during a turn, the higher the center of gravity, the more likely the vehicle is to lose control. Vehicle B has the highest center of gravity, so it is most likely to lose control. Vehicle B corresponds to Option A, so the answer is A.",

                "D": "Flash headlights and honk to alert other drivers"
            },
            "answer": "B",
            "explanation": "Option A, 'Take your foot off the accelerator,' is a reasonable defensive driving practice. Option B, 'Move to the left lane,' may conflict with oncoming traffic and is unsafe. Option C, 'Brake firmly without locking the brakes,' prevents loss of vehicle control. Option D, 'Flash headlights and honk to alert other drivers,' may effectively alert others.",

            },
            "answer": "A",
            "explanation": "Option A, 'Slow down and be prepared to stop,' is the safest action. Option B, 'Pull over to the side of the road and stop until the children leave,' is overly passive. Option C, 'Move to the left lane and maintain speed,' increases danger. Option D, 'Honk and maintain speed,' may cause panic.",

            "answer": "D",
            "explanation": "This question is tricky because it asks for the 'least safe' action, not the 'safest.' Options A, B, and C are all safe actions. Option D, 'Make sure they drive slowly,' is incorrect and dangerous behavior.",
