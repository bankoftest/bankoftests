   This question is somewhat tricky to understand. The analysis should go as follows: Drivers generally should not honk at cyclists unless in special situations that require issuing a warning. By elimination, options A, C, and D describe common situations. If honking were necessary in these cases, roads would constantly be filled with honking sounds.
